	<p>The mentor program offers Katalysts an opportunity to interact with mature, educated individuals from various professional fields outside their communities who can guide them and expose them to a new set of experiences and perspectives.</p>
<p>The two key differentiating factors between these girls and those from a more privileged background are the level of exposure to new experiences and a lack of a competent role model.</p>
<p>The mentor program aims at helping Katalysts define themselves, learn essential life skills and evaluate various career options. It is thus founded on four pillars of support as outlined below</p>
<ul class="list-number">
<li>Socio-emotional Support</li>
<li>Personality Development</li>
<li>Academic Support</li>
<li>Career guidance and support</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-title">About Us</h2>
<p>Katalyst aims to be a leader in this continual elevation and transformation of young women from low income communities to lead change in their professional and personal  spheres of life. Katalyst was set up in 2007 under the aegis of Human Capital for Third Sector, a section 25 not-for-profit company founded in 2005. Human Capital for Third Sector known under the brand, Third Sector Partners <a href="http://www.thirdsectorpartners.com/" target="_blank">(www.thirdsectorpartners.com)</a>is India’s first executive search firm for the social sector. To achieve this, Katalyst provides an enabling environment to enhance the employability of girl students pursuing professional degrees or courses.</p>


<h3><i>WHY KATALYST?</i></h3>
<p>Investing in education is the most effective way of reducing poverty. And, investing in Secondary School Education yields high dividends. Women account for one-half of the potential talent base throughout the world and therefore, over time, a nation’s competitiveness depends significantly on whether and how it educates and utilizes its female talent. The educational achievements of women can have ripple effects within the family and across generations. Hence, we at Katalyst are focusing on girls’ education in tertiary sector.</p>
<p>These “Katalysts” will then catalyze positive change and influence society creating a ripple effect and leading to economic and social empowerment.</p>
